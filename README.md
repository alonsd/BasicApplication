### Prerequisites
This project assumes you know about modern mobile applications architecture such as MVVM / MVI, common networking libraries such as Retrofit and Alamofire and concurrency methods such as Kotlin Coroutines / Swift Combine.

This project can save you alot of time when creating a new Android / iOS project from scratch - clone this project, change the package name, project name, generic variables to suit your naming needs and your ready to go. It comes really handy when you need to rebuild the same project over and over again, like for a job interview phase where you get a task for home which looks pretty much the same for most companies. 

### Installing

Clone the project to your local device. Once done, depending on your need - Android or iOS - you can delete the uneccesary folder if you wish.
The projects are set in a way that every relevant variable, method or view has the name "BasicApplication" in it so a refactor should not take more then 10 minutes including a project name change. After the necessary refactor you are ready to go with a solid ground!

### Built With

- Android Studio, Xcode.
