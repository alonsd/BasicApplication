# BasicApplication - Native Android in Kotlin and iOS in Swift! 

No more looking for dependencies, adding permissions, configuring DI -  this basic Android temple application has eveything you need for a fresh new mobile project. 
 
<img src="https://github.com/alonsd/BasicApplication/blob/main/Android%20Logo.png" width="50" height="50"/> ## Android - 
- [x] Solid MVVM architecture.
- [x] Network layer built with Retrofit + Coroutines + error handling wrapper with a demonstrated used API in the app.
- [x] Local database using Room library implemented and ready to use.
- [x] Service Locator using Koin is configured and used throughout the application.
- [x] Built for a Single-Activity application, Navigation Component is already predefined and a first fragment is already built onto it.
- [x] Powerful generic utility class for ListAdapter to prevent creating a new DiffUtil.ItemCallback class each time you create a new list.
- [x] SharedPreferences extension which makes saving small amounts of data extremely easy to use. 
- [x] Very commonly used dependencies such as Gson, Room, Glide and more are already pre-defined.

### Prerequisites
This project assumes you know how to work with MVVM architecture, Retrofit networking and Kotlin Coroutines.

If you do, this project can save you ALOT of time when creating a new Android project from scratch - just clone this project, change the package name, project name, generic variables to suit your naming needs and your ready to go. 

### Installing

Clone the project to your local device. Once done, depending on your need - Android or iOS - you can delete the uneccesary folder if you wish.
The projects are set in a way that every relevant variable, method or view has the name "BasicApplication" in it so a refactor should not take more then 10 minutes including a project name change. After the necessary refactor you are ready to go with a solid ground!

### Built With

- Android Studio, Xcode.
